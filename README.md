TopTal Exercise
====

This is a simple solution for TopTal exercise below:

> Write an application that tracks jogging times of users
> - User must be able to create an account and log in (done)
> - When logged in, user can see his times he entered (done)
> - Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time (done)
> - When displayed, each time entry has an average speed (done)
> - Filter by dates from-to
> - Report on average speed & distance per week
> - REST API â€“ for all user actions. In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate > that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
> - All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
> - Bonus: unit tests!
> - You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

How to run the tests:
---
    RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rake spec

Technologies used
---

 - Ruby (-v 2.0)
 - Ruby on Rails (-v 4.0.4)
 - jQuery
 - Rspec/Capybara/Selenium
 - Twitter Bootstrap 3.0

How to test RESTful API
---

You can can check out the controller code at app/controllers/api/v1 the same as for the views (used jBuilder) and can be found at app/views/api/v1

It's important to get the token and send it with the request so you can access the API

Each user has a token and can find it by Footer of the page

As for example, to get a list of entries for the logged in user 

    http://toptal-task.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries?token={your_token}

Steps to run it locally:
---
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rake db:seed
    bundle exec rails s

Please login as an admin (username: admin / pass: 1234) so you can check out all the admins features like tracking other accounts.

Notes:
---

- This is a reponsive design which is compatable with all the mobile devices.

- I chose Rails 4 for this exercise for simplicity, but usually in production mode I use Sinatra/Grape/Rack for simple API calls (for the RESTful API). 

- I'm using Ruby 2.0 (MRI) for simplicity, usually for production environment I use jRuby implementation with threaded server like Puma.

- Please note that I didn't use background workers with Resque/RabbitMQ or even use Celluloid directly for performance enhancements (I didn't consider scalability at this stage).
